Make sure any female condoms you buy carry the European CE mark or British BSI Kitemark.
Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16.
If you want contraception and are under 16, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist will not tell
your parents as long as they believe you fully understand your decisions and the information
you have been given.

Female condoms are 95% successful when used correctly. They stop you from getting pregnant
and getting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Before any contact with the penis,
a female condom must be inserted inside the vagina. Often purchase condoms with the CE or
BSI Kitemark on the package.
