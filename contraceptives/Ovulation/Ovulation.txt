In the first year of normal use, as many as 23 out of 100 women using the cervical mucus method
for birth control would become pregnant. With perfect use, the annual pregnancy rate may be as
low as three out of every 100 women.

The cervical mucus method is a type of natural family planning.

Billings Ovulation Method, the cervical mucus method is based on careful
observation of mucus patterns during your menstrual cycle. If you're hoping
to get pregnant, you can use the cervical mucus method to determine the best
days to have sex. If you want to avoid pregnancy, the cervical mucus method
can help you figure out which days to avoid unprotected sex. Using the cervical
mucus method for birth control requires motivation and diligence.

What you can expect

To avoid confusing cervical secretions with semen or normal sexual lubrication,
avoid sex or use a barrier method of contraception during your first cycle. Also
avoid douching, which can wash out cervical secretions and make it difficult to
notice changes. * Check your cervical secretions before and after urinating. If
you're hoping to avoid pregnancy, unprotected sex is off-limits from the day your
cervical secretions begin until four days after your peak day.

If you have sex before your cervical secretions begin, you may want to avoid sex the next
day and night so that you don't confuse semen and arousal fluids with cervical secretions.
Some health care providers also recommend avoiding unprotected sex or using a barrier
method of contraception during your period because it's difficult to detect cervical
secretions when they're mixed with menstrual blood. Interpreting and charting cervical
secretions can be challenging. Most women need more than one instructional session to
recognize the pattern of secretions in a typical menstrual cycle.
