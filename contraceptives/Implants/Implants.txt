Data compiled from 16 years of clinical and field studies indicate that NORPLANT is
not only safe and long-acting, it is also the most effective current reversible contraceptive method.
With at least a 99% rate of effectiveness, NORPLANT is more successful in preventing pregnancies than
oral contraceptives and IUDs, and just as effective as sterilization. NORPLANT involves the insertion
of hormonal implants that provide a continuous low-dose protection. Though containing a hormone similar
that of some OCs, NORPLANT does not require daily intakes.

While not medically harmful, these irregularities can prove problematic for some women in
certain cultures. Despite these drawbacks, continuation rates for NORPLANT have been high.
While many questions remain as to its long-term benefits and risks, NORPLANT seems well-suited
for women who wish to space their children or who which to avoid sterilization.
