SDM was found to be more than 95 percent
effective with proper use and 88 percent
effective with normal use in an efficacy trial.

SDM is a simple, modern, fertility awareness-based method of family
planning that was developed and tested by IRH in 2001. Given its ease
of use and lack of side effects, SDM appeals to many couples who are
not currently using any method and those who are concerned about the
side effects or health complications of hormonal methods. This family
planning method is an important addition to the method mix that brings
new users to family planning and helps many couples prevent unplanned pregnancy.

Effectiveness

That means that out of 100 women using the method for one year, fewer
than five of them would get pregnant if they used SDM correctly. When
pregnancies occurring with correct use and with incorrect use of the
method were added together, the total was approximately 12 pregnancies
for every 100 women/year of method use.

How does SDM work ?

CycleBeads, a color-coded string of beads, facilitates use of the Standard
Days Method by helping women track their menstrual cycle and identify their
fertile days. SDM works well for women who usually have menstrual cycles
between 26 and 32 days long. Women who have cycles shorter than 26 days or
longer than 32 days are not good candidates for this method. Also, women who
would not be able to avoid unprotected intercourse on the days they might get
pregnant are not likely to be successful using this method.
