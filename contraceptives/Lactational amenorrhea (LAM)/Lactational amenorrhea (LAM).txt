When compared to other contraceptive methods, the lactational amenorrhea approach is at least 98 percent reliable.

Experiments with LAM extended to 9-12 months are ongoing.
A 'Breastfeeding-LAM-Family Planning' team is very helpful in maternity wards
for promoting modern breastfeeding, LAM, and contraception, and for
alleviating barriers and misconceptions. The lactational amenorrhea method is at
least 98% effective, comparing favorably with other contraceptive methods. Introduction
of LAM in family planning programs demands training, attention to be given to working mothers,
positive attitudes of health personnel, close links between postpartum and family planning teams,
situation analysis, budgets, evaluations, follow-up activities, modifications of
record keeping systems and computing programs, and of national family planning guidelines.

In conclusion, LAM is an efficient family planning method which should be promoted.
The lactational amenorrhea method should always include the shift to another method
when its criteria are no longer implemented.
