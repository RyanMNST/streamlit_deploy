Female sterilisation is an operation to permanently prevent pregnancy.
The fallopian tubes are blocked or sealed to prevent the eggs reaching
the sperm and becoming fertilised.

<b>How it works</b>

Female sterilisation works by preventing eggs travelling down the fallopian tubes,
which link the ovaries to the womb.

<b>Is sterilisation right for me?</b>

Sterilisation reversal is not usually available on the NHS. You may also want to
consider which method of contraception suits you, such as long-acting reversible
contraception like an implant, device or injections.

<b>Before the operation</b>

Your GP may recommend counselling before referring you for sterilisation. Counselling
will give you a chance to talk about the operation in detail and discuss any doubts,
worries or questions you might have. Sterilisation can be performed at any stage in
your menstrual cycle.

<b>Recovering after the operation</b>

If you leave hospital within hours of the operation, take a taxi or ask a relative or
friend to pick you up. The healthcare professionals treating you in hospital will tell
you what to expect and how to care for yourself after surgery. If you have had a general
anaesthetic, do not drive a car for 48 hours afterwards.

Female sterilization has a success rate of over 99 percent in avoiding pregnancy.
You don't have to worry about preventing pregnancy every time you have sex, so it
doesn't interfere with your sexual life.
