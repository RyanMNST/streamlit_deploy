What are hormonal contraceptives?

These contraceptives use hormones to
prevent pregnancy.

What are barrier methods?

Barrier methods stop sperm from entering the vagina.
Condoms protect against sexually transmissible infections
and from unintended pregnancy.

What is emergency contraception?

If you are an average weight, the ECP is 98% effective.
If you weigh more than 70kg, the ECP is less effective and
a copper IUD is recommended. The copper IUD can be inserted
up to five days after unprotected sex, and is more than 99%
effective at preventing pregnancy. It is not a good idea to
use ECP as your regular method of contraception - it is less
effective than if you were using a LARC or hormonal method.

What is permanent contraception?

Permanent contraception, sometimes called sterilisation, prevents all
future pregnancies. Permanent contraception is either a vasectomy or a tubal ligation.
