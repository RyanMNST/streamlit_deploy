<b>What are hormonal contraceptives?</b>

These contraceptives use hormones to
prevent pregnancy.

<b>What are barrier methods?</b>

Barrier methods stop sperm from entering the vagina.
Condoms protect against sexually transmissible infections
and from unintended pregnancy.

<b>What is emergency contraception?</b>

If you are an average weight, the ECP is 98% effective.
If you weigh more than 70kg, the ECP is less effective and
a copper IUD is recommended. The copper IUD can be inserted
up to five days after unprotected sex, and is more than 99%
effective at preventing pregnancy. It is not a good idea to
use ECP as your regular method of contraception - it is less
effective than if you were using a LARC or hormonal method.

<b>What is permanent contraception?</b>

Permanent contraception, sometimes called sterilisation, prevents all
future pregnancies. Permanent contraception is either a vasectomy or a tubal ligation.
