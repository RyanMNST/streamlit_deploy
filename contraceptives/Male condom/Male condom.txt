Male condoms are 98 percent successful when properly used any time you have sex.
When male condoms are used as contraceptives, this translates to 2 out of 100 women
being pregnant in a year. Concealment clinics, reproductive wellbeing clinics, and some
GP surgeries all have free condoms.

<b>How a condom works</b>

They are made of very thin latex , polyurethane or
polyisoprene and are designed to prevent pregnancy by stopping
sperm from meeting an egg. They can also protect against STIs
if used correctly during vaginal, anal and oral sex.

<b>Using lubricant</b>

Condoms come lubricated to make them easier to use, but you may also
like to use additional lubricant . You can use any type of lubricant
with polyurethane condoms that are not made of latex.

<b>Condoms with spermicide</b>

Some condoms come with spermicide on them.
